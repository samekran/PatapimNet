attacking wild and cultivated apple and crabapple.

Heavily infected fruits are usually misshapen and may crack and drop prematurely. Photo by K. Peter.    Skip to the beginning of the images gallery    Symptoms\\nApple scab can be observed on leaves, petioles, sepals, fruit and pedicels and, less frequently, on young shoots and bud scales. The first infections often occur on the leaves surrounding flower buds. Dull, olive-green areas visible on the undersides of leaves are the first evidence of the disease. As the lesions (infected areas) become older, they assume a definite outline as olive-green or brown circular spots. Severe early leaf infection can result in dwarfed, twisted leaves, which may drop later in the season.\\nEarly infection may occur on the calyx (blossom end of the fruit) or on the pedicel (fruit stem). Severe pedicel infection results in fruit drop. Fruit may become infected at any time in its development. Typical fruit lesions are distinct, almost circular, rough-surfaced, olive-green spots up to ¾ inch in diameter. Heavily infected fruits are usually misshapen and may crack and drop prematurely. When leaf infection is active just before harvest, the fruit may become infected. These spots do not show at harvest time but develop slowly, while the apples are in storage. This phase of apple scab disease is termed \"pinpoint scab\" or \"storage scab.\"\\nDisease Cycle\\nThe apple scab fungus (Venturia inaequalis) overwinters in infected leaves that have fallen to the ground. Fruiting bodies are produced within the dead leaf tissue. During late winter and early spring, ascospores mature (primary phase). During the spring, when overwintered leaves on the orchard floor become wet from rain or heavy dew, ascospores are forcibly discharged and disseminated by wind and will initiate infections on new growth.\\xa0The ascospores are not all discharged with the first spring rains, for they mature over a 4- to 6-week period. This period usually coincides with the time that elapses from ¼ inch green until 2 to 3 weeks after petal fall. Mature ascospores peak from late pink through petal fall, which is the most critical time for protection during the primary phase of the disease. especially if ideal environmental conditions favoring disease are present.\\nConditions for Infection\\nWhen the spores land on wet apple buds, leaves, or fruit, and if they remain wet for a few hours, they germinate and grow into the apple tissue. The time required for germination and penetration depends on temperature and the presence of a wet surface. At 39°F, 28 hours of continuous wetting is required for infection, while at 61 to 75°F, only 6 hours are required (See new updated table in Tree Fruit Production Guide). After the fungus has penetrated, it continues to grow and enlarge beneath the cuticle. After 9 to 17 days (development occurs most rapidly at higher temperatures), a visible scab lesion is produced. On its surface appear more spores (conidia), which are easily dislodged when the lesions are wet. The spores are splashed around by rain and blown by wind to new leaf and fruit surfaces within the tree. They germinate on wet surfaces, infect the tissue, and produce a new lesion. In this manner, several secondary infection cycles may occur in the course of a growing season. Infection is rare above 78°F.\\nDisease Management\\nSanitation can be effective for managing apple scab. Leaf tissue is necessary for the spores to survive and orchards are self-infecting since spores can travel about 100 feet. To reduce the number of available overwintering spores present, apply a 5 percent solution of urea (46-0-0) in water to apple trees as leaves begin to fall in the autumn to aid in the breakdown of leaf tissue (42 pounds of urea in 100 gallons of water). Urea may also be sprayed on the leaves on the ground, after all the leaves have fallen. If urea is not used, any ammonium-based nitrogen will be sufficient. \\xa0Since nitrogen is being applied, adjust your fertilizer program accordingly. Shredding leaf litter using a flail mower or remove leaf litter by raking, sweeping, or vacuuming are additional options. Shredding leaf litter assists the decay of the plant material, as well as aids in the reorienting the leaves, thereby disrupting ascospore discharge.\\nScab infections may be prevented by applying fungicides at regular intervals throughout the growing season, preferably before wetting events. The object is to provide a protective coating that will inactivate any spores landing on the fruit and foliage. It is critical to control scab early in the season, from bud emergence through the second cover period. The most important time during this period will be from late pink through petal fall. This will be the greatest threat for infection if disease conditions occur since the maximum amount of mature ascospores will be available. If disease conditions are favorable from late pink through petal fall, growers are encouraged to use complete sprays for greatest protection. \\xa0If scab infection can be prevented during the time all the ascospores are discharged from the fruiting bodies in the fallen leaves, the disease cycle is broken and no further source of infection remains for the rest of the season. However, if the cycle is not controlled, and leaf and fruit infection occurs, then conidia are produced on these lesions and scab will remain a constant threat all season whenever wet weather occurs.\\nGrowers are encouraged to rotate chemicals by FRAC Groups when controlling for apple scab (\"spraying by the numbers\"), as well as tank-mixing with a broad-spectrum fungicide, such as a rainfast mancozeb to minimize fungicide resistance. During very wet conditions early in the season, using a rainfast mancozeb or adding a spreader-sticker adjuvant to the tank mix\\xa0when a non-rainfast mancozeb is used\\xa0will allow mancozeb to persist a little longer despite heavy rainfall. This will allow a buffer time for reapplication of fungicides. The apple scab fungus is prone to fungicide resistance and fungicide resistance management is necessary.\\nThe selection of scab-resistant varieties can help reduce the need to control this disease. Specific chemical\\xa0recommendations for commercial growers are in the Penn State Tree Fruit Production Guide.  Agenda  Authors       Kari A.

The fruit may show dark, sunken lesions, and the flesh beneath may be discolored and stringy. Treatment involves cultural management, such as removing and destroying infected plant parts, practicing good sanitation, and planting resistant varieties.

Treatment involves cultural management, such as collecting and removing fallen leaves and infected twigs, and sanitation practices like leaf litter removal and pruning, ideally done in the fall or winter before bud break. Resistant cultivars are the best way to prevent apple scab, with many species and cultivars of apple and crabapple being resistant to the scab fungus. Chemical management, such as fungicide sprays applied at bud swell and according to label directions, can also effectively manage apple scab by reducing primary infection.\\nHuman: How did IBM use watsonx at the 2024 US Open Tennis Championship?\\nAI: IBM did not use Watsonx at the 2024 US Open Tennis Championship.
